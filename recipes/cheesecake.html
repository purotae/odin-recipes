    <p>Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake recipe! 
        Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. 
        For the best results, bake in a water bath.</p>
    <p>
        To me, classic cheesecake is creamy, rich, and smooth. 
        My cheesecake recipe is not as dense as New York cheesecake, 
        but it’s just as special. It’s thick, it’s velvety, and there’s no denying its decadence. 
        When I imagine what Chandler and Rachel’s stolen cheesecake tastes like, it’s this!
