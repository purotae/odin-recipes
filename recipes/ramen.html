    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper</li>
        <li>unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>fresh garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the sesame oil into a large pot and heat over medium heat. Add in the garlic and ginger and saut√© for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add in the sliced mushrooms and cook for 3-5 minutes or until softened.</li>
        <li> Pour in the chicken stock, water, and soy sauce.</li>
        <li>Then bring to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the bokchoy and then simmer for an additional 2 minutes to soften the leaves.</li>
        <li> Remove the pot from the heat. Then place the ramen noodles in the hot pot of broth. Allow the noodles to sit for ONLY a couple of minutes until they loosen and soften up. The noodles will soften quickly, so this should be done right before serving. </li>
        <li>Divide the ramen, veggies, and broth evenly into bowls.</li>
        <li>Top the ramen with sliced grilled chicken and soft boiled eggs. Then garnish with toppings of choice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
